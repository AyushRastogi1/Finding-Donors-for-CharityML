# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

This project aims to identify most important features associated with donors to a charity by applying supervised learning to the dataset of charity donors. First, a data pipeline is created via data cleaning and normalization. Then, Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers are used for model training and grid search is used to get an optimized model, which yields accuracy of 85% and F-score of 73% on test data.
